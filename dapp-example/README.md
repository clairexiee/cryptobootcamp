# Example dApp

This codebase demonstrates a _very_ simple dApp in the form of a Storefront.

Explore the code or try running some of these commands:

```shell
npm run install
npm run test
npm run server
npm run ui
```

## Environment

To truly use this, make sure to add a `.env` file with the following:

```
STOREFRONT_ADDRESS=<STOREFRONT-CONTRACT-ADDRESS>
WEB3_URI=wss://goerli.infura.io/ws/v3/<YOUR-API-KEY>
```
